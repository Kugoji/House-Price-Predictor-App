# Calgary House Price Predictor App 
A personal project of mine where I provide data analysis, make multiple machine learning models, and allow users to then predict what the price of a house might be in **Calgary, AB** given their own parameter choices!  
Here's the link to interact with the app directly: https://yyc-house-prices.streamlit.app 

## How It's Made
**Tech & Libraries used:** `Python`, `Streamlit`, `Pandas`, `Numpy`, `Statsmodels`, `Scikit-learn`, `Plotly`

To make this app, I did the coding in `Python`, utilizing the `streamlit` library in order to design the front-end. This app uses an expansive kaggle dataset that contains information on houses within **Calgary**. The data was pulled from various real-estate websites in **2023** and as such, the prices present in the dataset may be slightly outdated. Also, while expansive, the dataset does **not** contain the information of **all** house prices in Calgary, only houses found on **public listing sites** will be present.  

To use this app, there are 3 modes the user can select from:  
`EDA Mode`  
`Model Results Mode`  
`Prediction Mode`
